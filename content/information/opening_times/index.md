We prefer payment to be made via Bank Transfer, however, we do accept childcare tax credits and accept a range of childcare vouchers, including the new Government Childcare vouchers.  Information is available on request.

The majority of our children attend sessions regularly, however, adhoc (Casual or Holiday Club) sessions are also available and are dependent on the number of children attending any one session.

Payment for adhoc sessions MUST be made in advance via https://bookwhen.com/woosc

All children MUST be registered with Wickwar Out of School Club before they can attend any of the club or holiday sessions. Re-enrolment each September is required, and we require a new registration form for your child annually at this time.
