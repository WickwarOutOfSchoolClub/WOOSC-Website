Please note that the Club must be informed if your child/ren are booked into the After School Club but will not be attending, for example, going to a friend’s house. If we are not informed, your child will be classed as ‘missing’ and the Missing Child Policy procedures will be put into action, which could result in the police being informed.

* If your child is unwell and therefore will not be attending a booked Before School session, please telephone the club by 7.50am on the morning of their absence.  This number is diverted to a staff member where possible outside normal club operating hours, but if your call is not answered please text a message, this will be picked up by a member of staff when the club opens.
* If your child falls ill during the school day and is taken home and therefore will not be attending a booked After School session, please telephone the club or text a message at any time which will be picked up by a member of staff when the club opens.
* If your child is unwell and will not be attending a booked After School session, please telephone the club by 8.45am on the morning of their absence.
* If your child will not be attending a booked After School session for any other reason, for example going to a friends house after school instead of attending the after school club, please telephone the club or text a message at any time which will be picked up by a member of staff when the club opens.
