For many years we have been trying to improve the outside environment as the inside areas we have can get noisy.

As of covid, we are trying to encourage outside playing more as it is healthier for the children and gives them more freedom on what to do

To help with this, we have been given funding for:

* Outside lights so the children can play outside during winter and autumn months while still being in the light.
* Sheds to store our outside play equipment alongside the toys for the children to use
* A quiet space for the children to chill out in with a mud kitchen for them to use


Our site is located on the grounds of Alexander Hosea Primary School within the community center rooms.
