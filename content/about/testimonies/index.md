_"Overall myself and my wife are very impressed by WOOSC and feel completely at ease with them looking after our daughter, and hopefully both our daughters from September...
The cost of WOOSC is good value and is a huge asset to the adjacent school to have such good childcare available practically on the same site."_

_"I just wanted to highlight how happy my daughter has been at WOOSC, and there's really nothing negative I can say about the care she receives...
The staff have always kept me updated and tried to help with any little issues the children may have around navigating relationships etc. As far as I'm concerned WOOSC is an extension of our family and we're really grateful to you all!"_
