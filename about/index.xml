Wickwar Out of School Club (WOOSC) provides before and after school care for children from the age of 4 up to Year 8 of secondary school. WOOSC may offer to provide holiday care only for children from the age of 4 up to Year 8 of secondary school where numbers and staffing allow information available on request.</description></item><item><title>Menu</title><link>https://woosc.org.uk/about/food/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woosc.org.uk/about/food/</guid><description>This is an example of the food we offer to the children each week.

As of covid, we are trying to encourage outside playing more as it is healthier for the children and gives them more freedom on what to do
To help with this, we have been given funding for:
Outside lights so the children can play outside during winter and autumn months while still being in the light.</description></item><item><title>Our Environment</title><link>https://woosc.org.uk/about/gallery/our_environment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woosc.org.uk/about/gallery/our_environment/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Play</title><link>https://woosc.org.uk/about/gallery/play/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woosc.org.uk/about/gallery/play/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sports</title><link>https://woosc.org.uk/about/gallery/sports/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woosc.org.uk/about/gallery/sports/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Testimonies</title><link>https://woosc.org.uk/about/testimonies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woosc.org.uk/about/testimonies/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Overall myself and my wife are very impressed by WOOSC and feel completely at ease with them looking after our daughter, and hopefully both our daughters from September&amp;hellip; The cost of WOOSC is good value and is a huge asset to the adjacent school to have such good childcare available practically on the same site.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I just wanted to highlight how happy my daughter has been at WOOSC, and there&amp;rsquo;s really nothing negative I can say about the care she receives&amp;hellip; The staff have always kept me updated and tried to help with any little issues the children may have around navigating relationships etc.</description></item><item><title>The Site</title><link>https://woosc.org.uk/about/site/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woosc.org.uk/about/site/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Visits</title><link>https://woosc.org.uk/about/gallery/visits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woosc.org.uk/about/gallery/visits/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Whats On</title><link>https://woosc.org.uk/about/whats-on/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woosc.org.uk/about/whats-on/</guid><description>What a brilliant holiday club we just had, come back later to see what else is on!</description></item></channel></rss>
